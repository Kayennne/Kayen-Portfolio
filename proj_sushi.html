                <p>Task: You are a small game design firm that wants to publish its first card game. As a team, you 
                    need to come up with a prototype to pitch to the toy fairs in December. If the publishers like 
                    your game, they will strike a deal with you to produce the game and distribute it around the 
                    world.
                    
                    
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="here-links">This was a project that required constant prototyping and testing, ideating and improving, over
                    and over again, until the game was good. It put a test to our game mechanic skills and thinking. Also having to
                    think about how we can make the game affect the player emotionally and instincts. In this project, I designed the
                    rulebook and sushi menu. And also developed the game mechanics and idea.

                     and items on his menu. The chefs have to earn themselves these different popular sushi ingredients and build their 
                     sushi to add to the menu. At the same time take down your competitors and have the best sushi restaurant on the street!
