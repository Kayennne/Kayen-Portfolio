                    <p>Open house 2024 was the first event I was in charge of after being appointed 
                        Vice-President of Events. It was my first huge step to becoming a better leader.
                        Being more independant and having to manage more behind the scene stuff, it was
                        definitely a good experience as my first planning event. I got to see the student 
                        leaders take charge on their own, initiating conversations with one another, as well 
                        as with the visitors, I was very proud!!

                    <p class="here-links">This was a tough event, given a tight timeline of 1 week, to gather freshmen to join us
                        in the dance competition and teach them the choreography (we had 30 sign ups but more than 15 dropped out D:). 
                        But nonetheless, my team and I pulled through, including the wonderful freshies that stayed with us till the end.
                        We have a very fun but tiring week , spending almost everyday with one another practicing the dance. Everyone bonded
                        well, and I was so amazed by how the freshies connected with one another so quickly. I'm so grateful for this team!

                        one elderly, and I met this wonderful lady that shared with me about her family and her children, and her thoughts on 
                        our modern generation. I think it was quite refreshing to listen to perspectives of someone from a different generation, 
                        because the insights they give is different from what you hear from your peers. Also, she is a really good painter!! She
                        has paintings hanging on the walls of the centre.

                        we had educational visits to cultural sites, played group bonding games, and so much

                    <h2>Youth Expedition Project - Klang</h2>
                    <h4>13-24 March 2023</h4>
                    
                    <p>In this trip, our aim was to teacher refugee students in Klang, more about how to implement technology
                        into education, and use it in the workforce. This was the first overseas trip I went to in Poly, and I would love to say that I've made
                        lifelong friends here. 12 days, 22 people, everyone lived together in a Shalom, we ate together, played 
                        card games together. We made lots of great memories together on this trip. In addition, we made friends 
                        with the refugee students there. Even though we were supposed to be seen as "teachers", we were the ones that learnt 
                        from them. In fact, they were more knowledgable than us, one of the students had his own Youtube channel
                        where he shares internet hacks, and another who is fluent in the python coding language. This trip was really an
                        educational one

                    <h4>12-14 April 2023</h4>
                    
                    <p>I love Freshman Orientation Camps! I did the same in secondary school, and was so glad when I 
                        got the chance to do it again in Poly. I really loved the class I was assigned to, they all 
                        bonded and created their own friend groups really easily even without me having to intervene.
                        Lots of them shared the same interest which made me really happy, because they all had something
                        they could talk about. Moreover, my clan, Centaur, was so fun to be with, we bonded over training 
                        days and I got to know them better, it made me really glad to work with these bunch!

                    <p>My first ICT event! Went through over a month of dance practices
                        over the september holidays. It was really tiring but so much fun! I 
                        got to meet new people from different years, and it really expanded
                        my social circle beyond my classroom. In this event, we won 3rd place! 
                        And this was the event was where I met my 
                        best friend! And also was the start to my eagerness to join more events in 
                        ICT! Thus this event holds a really special place in my heart
