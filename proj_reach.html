                <p>Task:   To conceptualise, propose, create and develop an Interactive Web Experience.
                    <br>
                    Goal: To utilize the web platforms to create an interactive application that resolves to aid an online 
                    experience. The main consideration is on how to tap on gamification concepts using quality visuals 
                    and 3D to make a fun experience for users.

                <p class="here-links">This is the first Integrated Project I had in Poly, where we are required to form a team
                    of 2 and come up with a project that integrated all the modules we had in that semester. In this project,
                    I coded the front-end of the website, using html and css, as well as created models to be showcased. It was 
                    truly a challenge as back then, I was not very good with html and css, but I definitely gained a lot more confidence
                    as I had to consistently code throughout the project which helped me improve! Check out the website

                <p>REACH is a platform for parents to share their knowledge on parenting. It may be a scary 
                    experience for parents, especially if it's their first, as they never know what to expect. 
                    We aim to help ease parenting for parents, and help them create lasting memories and form
                    stronger bonds with their loved ones
